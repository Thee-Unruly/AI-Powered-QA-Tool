1. The system should respond quickly under load, ensuring that even during periods of high user activity or data processing, the overall performance remains consistent and efficient without significant delays.

2. User data must always be encrypted to ensure security and privacy, although in certain use cases, such as during processing or caching, the data may be temporarily stored in a less persistent form.

3. The password reset feature may be implemented as needed, depending on user feedback or administrative discretion, allowing for flexibility in system design and user experience.

4. Logs are to be stored by the system automatically, capturing essential events and system operations for monitoring, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes without requiring manual intervention.

5. Reports should be generated in a sufficiently detailed manner, providing comprehensive insights, metrics, and summaries that support decision-making, but avoiding excessive complexity.

6. The admin might configure the dashboard manually, allowing them to tailor the layout, data sources, and widgets based on organizational needs or personal preferences, though automation options may exist.

7. Email verification is mandatory but optional in sandbox mode, where real-time verification is enforced in production environments, while being relaxed in testing scenarios to support developer efficiency.

8. Error messages are displayed when a failure occurs, offering users or administrators enough information to understand the issue, though without exposing sensitive internal system details.

9. The UI can adapt to user preferences, modifying themes, layouts, or accessibility options in response to user settings, enhancing usability and inclusivity across different user groups.

10. Backup must be taken regularly as required, following organizational policies or regulations, while allowing for dynamic scheduling based on system activity or administrator-defined intervals.
